            <b> L) Cookies and Tracking Technologies: </b> When you use
            TOKENIZER services, we and our business partners may use cookies and
            other tracking technologies (collectively “Cookies”) for a variety
            of purposes and to enhance your online experience, for example, by
            remembering your log-in status and viewing preferences from a
            previous use of our services, for when you later return to
            TOKENIZER. <br />
            a. When you visit our website, use our mobile application or
            TOKENIZER Services, or visit a third-party website for which we
            provide online services, we and certain business partners and
            vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies. We use
            Cookies to recognize you as a customer; customize TOKENIZER
            Services, other content and advertising; measure the effectiveness
            of promotions; perform a wide range of analytics; mitigate risk and
            prevent potential fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our
            site sand TOKENIZER Services. <br />
            b. Certain aspects and features of the TOKENIZER Services and our
            website are only available through the use of Cookies, so if you

            advertisers and other third parties. We do not respond to DNT
            signals. <br />
            d. A few additional important things you should know about our use
            of tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, HTML-5 stored
            technologies): <br />
            e. We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Cookies
            can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until
            you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close
            your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technologies
            if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your
            use of TOKENIZER Services. Refer to the help section of your
            browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for
            instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking

            Investing in securities, tokens, coins, and other digital assets
            involves risks, and there is always the potential of losing money
            when you invest. Before investing, consider your investment
            objectives. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any
            historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections may

            and its affiliates cannot make any investment recommendations or
            otherwise provide any investment advice and nothing available

            Before you invest, you should read the offering materials related to
            your investment. You alone assume the sole responsibility of
            evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of any
            TOKENIZER service before making any decisions.
